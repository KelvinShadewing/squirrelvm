[HOW TO USE]
Simply drag a .nut file onto the executable or run the program and type the name of a .nut in the same folder. When entering a name, don't worry about the extension; the program will add that on automatically.

Entering an invalid or non-existent filename will do nothing, as though you'd run an empty script.
